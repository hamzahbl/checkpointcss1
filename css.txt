3 BASIC kinds  SELECTORS ARE IN CSS :
type selectors
 are used to select HTML elements by element name. 
class selectors
 are used to select HTML elements by a specific class value. 
id selectors
 are used to select an HTML element associated with a specific id value.



the id selector when it is used in the css it has to be proceded by #

The CSS box model is defined by these four layers:

Content: the content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding: the padding is transparent, clears an area around the content.
Border: a border that goes around the padding and content. We have already seen it earlier.
Margin: clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.




THE BORDER :
border-width: Specifies the thickness of the border.
<length>: A numeric value measured in px, em, rem, vh and vw units.
thin: The equivalent of 1px
medium: The equivalent of 3px
thick: The equivalent of 5px
border-style: Specifies the type of line drawn around the element, including:
solid: A solid, continuous line.
none (default): No line is drawn.
hidden: A line is drawn, but not visible. this can be useful for adding a little extra width to an element without displaying a border.
dashed: A line that consists of dashes.
dotted: A line that consists of dots.
double: Two lines are drawn around the element.
groove: Adds a bevel based on the color value in a way that makes the element appear pressed into the document.
idge: Similar to groove, but reverses the color values in a way that makes the element appear raised.
inset: Adds a split tone to the line that makes the element appear slightly depressed.
outset: Similar to inset, but reverses the colors in a way that makes the element appear slightly raised.
color: Specifies the color of the border and accepts <rgb()>, <rgba()>, <code><hsl()>, <hsla()>, <hex-color>, <named-color>

Color

It changes the text color, it accepts a named color, hexadecimal value and rgb value.

 color: rgb(0, 0, 255);
  /* same as
  color: blue;
  color: #0000ff;
  color: #00f;
  color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); */
Font-style

It's used to turn italic text on and off. Possible values are as follows (you'll rarely use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some reason).

 font-style: bold;
/*
other possible value
 font-style:normal;
 font-style:italic;
 font-style:oblique;
*/
Font-weight
It sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you have many font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold, -black, etc.), but, realistically, you'll rarely use any of them except for normal and bold.

 font-weight: normal;
/*
other possible value
 font-weight:bold;
 font-weight:bolder;
 font-weight:lighter;
 font-weight:100-900
*/
Text-decoration

It sets or unsets text decorations on fonts (you'll mainly use this to unset the default underline on links when styling them.) Available values are:

 text-decoration: none;
/*
other possible value
 text-decoration:underline;
 text-decoration:overline;
 text-decoration:line-through;
*/




display:none
 : hides the element with the correspondent SELECTOR. 
display:inline
 :enables you to make the specified HTML elements in the same line. 
display:inline-block
 :display blocks the same line.
